# Email Setup for SEVENTEENVISUALS

## Gmail App Password Setup

To enable email functionality, you need to set up a Gmail App Password:

2. **Generate App Password**:

   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security â†’ 2-Step Verification â†’ App passwords
   - Select "Mail" and generate a password
   - Copy the 16-character password (without spaces)

3. **Update .env file**:
   ```
   EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
   ```

## Email Design & Flow

The emails now match your website's cinematic dark theme:

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "date": "2024-12-01",
