Seventeen Visuals â€” Server

This folder contains a small Express + Mongoose server used to accept booking requests and manage them.

Quick overview

- POST /api/bookings -> create a new booking (public)
- GET /api/bookings/:id -> get booking by bookingId (public)
- GET /api/bookings -> list bookings (admin only)
- PATCH /api/bookings/:id/approve -> approve booking (admin only)
- DELETE /api/bookings/:id -> delete booking (admin only)

Booking ID format

- Booking IDs are generated as: SVN-### (e.g. SVN-001). A `Counter` collection tracks the next sequence value.

Example `.env` (see `.env.example`):
